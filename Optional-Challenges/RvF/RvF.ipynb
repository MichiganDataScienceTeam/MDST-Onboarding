    "This is a demo workbook from a MDST legacy project: Real vs Fake face Detection. The workbook was adapted from W24 project session, which was instructed by Sachchit Kunichetty and Zain Zai. If you are interested in this project, feel free to visit [here](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/W24-RvF) for more resources.\n",

    "Deepfakes are everywhere now, and like us you're probably wondering \"wow how am I going to figure out if that video of Morgan Freeman telling me he isn't real, is actually real?\". While a true deepfake detector is too complicated for a single workbook, we're going to do something a little bit easier - try and determine whether a picture of a face is fake or not. To solve this task, we will be using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)\n",

    "## Step 1: Define Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous advantages for preprocessing, depending on the topic of your program. For our project on CNN for RvF, the two major benefits of preprocessing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization\n",
    "Normalization brings features onto a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process due to larger magnitude. By normalizing the data, we ensure that each feature contributes proportionally to the learning process, leading to efficient convergence and model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "Preprocessing techniques help to generalize the model better to unseen data by introducing variability in the training images. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data. Examples of such preprocessing are random crop, random jitter, etc.\n",
