# MDST Tutorials - F22

## Setup

If you haven't already, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejP37JodiO97Kf5hL7Hr-KfC8fbaeyEgdg-342Tf9bIzrmmA/viewform) and join our mailing list. This will keep you up-to-date on the club.

First, follow the general setup [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AOCdbztv6G0t5cha2_9buWi-MrCUS0vN20rbpKg-GI/edit?usp=sharing). 

Then, complete the Git setup [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pq42R2xr_yoyhyzWE0ugReHgEKgwLdjrJR4mT3_CQEo/edit?usp=sharing). 

For most people, this is the *hardest* part of the tutorial! If you feel frustrated, know it is normal. Come see us at tutorial sections or office hours and we will help you sort it out.

## Tutorials & Checkpoints 

First, fill out `about_me.txt`.

Then start with `tutorial0` and `checkpoint0` in the `tutorial0` folder. The checkpoint is designed so you can either complete it as you go through the tutorial or tackle it once you have gone through the entire tutorial. 

Proceed to `tutorial1` and `checkpoint1` in the `tutorial1` folder. We recommend working through the tutorial before attempting the checkpoint. 

The two challenges in the `Optional Challenges` folder are completely optional. You will find instructions about them in the submission section.

Take your time and start early, there is a lot to learn!

## Live Tutorials & Office Hours

These checkpoints are *not* meant to be selective. Their sole purpose is to give you sufficient foundational knowledge about Python and some important packages so you can start contributing to a project. 

The definition of success for us is to have everyone who begins the tutorials finish them. Thus, we will offer support in two ways:

- Sunday Tutorials: Live tutorials will be held on 9/11 and 9/18 from 12 to 3 in Mason Hall. We do not have rooms booked so watch your email for the exact room number closer to the start. These will be a combination of us going over sections of the tutorials as requested by new members and hosting office hours. 

- Weekday Office Hours: We will be offering office hours from 7 to 9 PM on 9/7, 9/14, and 9/21. We will offer these both in-person in East Hall (Math) Atrium and on zoom (link will be posted on the website). 

Join the mailing list and monitor the tutorials [page](https://www.mdst.club/tutorials) on our website to make sure you hear about upcoming tutorials and office hours.

## Submission

A submission form where you will also indicate your project preferences will be released via both email and our [website](mdst.club) in the upcoming weeks. The submission deadline is tentatively set at `11:59 PM, 9/25`. You *absolutely* must submit the form by the deadline to work on a project this semester.

In your submission, we are looking for:
- [REQUIRED] checkpoint 0 and checkpoint 1. These are assessed by completion and effort. These materials are non-trivial and it is totally fine to make some mistakes.
- [OPTIONAL] ML Challenge and Stats Challenge. These are assessed by merit. We usually put new members on beginning projects for their very first semester but you may want to work on advanced projects right away if you are experienced with data science. You will be able to demonstrate said experience in these two challenges. You can choose to complete one or both of them.

It is strongly recommended for you to complete at least one challenge if the project you are most interested in is labelled as an advanced project. This will give you the best chance to be placed on that team.
